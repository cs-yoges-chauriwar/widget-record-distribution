### What's New

- Added Internationalization support for Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese languages.

- When users return to the records list after viewing a record in detail, the additional grid filter conditions they applied are retained. Previously, returning to the records list widget's View All Records option filter was applied, but the additional grid filter conditions were cleared.
